This is a GitHub repository for my Master's Thesis.

The folder training/batchTrainingV9 contains training scripts for local and Metacentrum training of neural networks in PyTorch with HuggingFace Accelerate library. The training/batchTrainingV10 is newer version improved configuration approach and correct distributed training implementation (port fix for Accelerate, it's now able to run multiple trianing on the same Metacentrum node).

All REXYGEN schemes for cam shooting and inference are in /rex folder.
